            <p>Email marketing is constantly evolving, and 2026 is shaping up to be a transformative year. Here are the top trends you need to know:</p>
            <h3>1. AI-Driven Hyper-Personalization</h3>
            <p>Generic "Hi [Name]" emails are no longer enough. AI is enabling marketers to send content based on real-time behavior, predictive analytics, and individual preferences.</p>
            <h3>2. Interactive Emails (AMP for Email)</h3>
            <p>Users can now take action directly within the email—booking appointments, filling out forms, or browsing carousels—without ever leaving their inbox.</p>
            <h3>3. Privacy-First Marketing</h3>
            <p>With stricter data privacy laws, zero-party data (data users willingly share) is becoming gold. Transparency and trust are paramount.</p>
            <p>Stay ahead of these trends to ensure your campaigns remain effective and engaging.</p>
